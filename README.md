I created this wedding website for my brother in law's wedding.  I started with a bootsrap template called the [Agency](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) template.  

I made several changes including adding a carousel for the photos section.

It was a fun project to reinforce the skills I've been learning from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) and their "Building Websites from Scratch" Pro Intensive course.
